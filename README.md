<h3>Title of the project:</h3>
 DHT11-with-adafruit-dashboard

<h3>Description:</h3>
The DHT11 is a temperature and humidity sensor that can be used with the Adafruit Dashboard to display sensor data on a web page. The DHT11 sensor is connected to a ESP8266, which reads the sensor data and sends it to the Adafruit Dashboard over a network connection. The dashboard can then display the data in real-time, and allow users to view historical data, set alarms, and more.

<h3>Objectif:</h3>
The objective of this project is to create a system that utilizes a DHT11 sensor to measure temperature and humidity, and then display this data on a web page using the Adafruit Dashboard, while also sending this data to a Line messaging app to allow users to monitor the sensor data through the app. This project can be used in various applications such as monitoring temperature and humidity in a greenhouse, server room, or any other environment where temperature and humidity need to be monitored.

<h3>List of devices:</h3>
